Project Summary -
Introduction
The hotel industry operates in a highly competitive environment, making it imperative for hoteliers to continuously adapt and innovate to remain ahead. A critical aspect of maintaining a competitive edge is understanding customer behavior and booking trends. This can be achieved through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of hotel booking data, which provides valuable insights into customer preferences, booking patterns, and potential areas for strategic improvement. This analysis aims to reveal key aspects of customer behavior and hotel booking trends, enabling hotels to enhance their business outcomes.

Customer Behavior Analysis
Demographic Insights
Understanding the demographics of customers is foundational to tailoring marketing and service strategies effectively. By analyzing data on age, nationality, and travel purposes, hotels can gain a clearer picture of their customer base. For instance, identifying the predominant age groups among guests can help in customizing promotional campaigns. If the majority of customers are young adults, marketing efforts could focus on adventure activities and nightlife. Conversely, if older adults are more prevalent, promotions might highlight comfort and relaxation amenities.

Nationality analysis can reveal the most common countries of origin for guests, allowing hotels to tailor their services to meet the cultural and linguistic needs of these groups. For example, if a significant portion of guests comes from a particular country, hotels could offer services in that country’s language or include cuisine that caters to their tastes.

Understanding the primary reasons for travel—be it leisure, business, or other purposes—enables hotels to customize their offerings accordingly. Leisure travelers might prioritize amenities like pools, spas, and sightseeing tours, while business travelers may value high-speed internet, meeting rooms, and quick check-in/check-out services.

Booking Preferences
Analyzing booking preferences is crucial for optimizing operational efficiency and marketing strategies. One key metric is the lead time, which is the period between when a booking is made and the guest’s actual arrival. Different customer segments may exhibit varying lead times. For instance, business travelers might book closer to their travel dates, while leisure travelers may plan further in advance. Understanding these patterns helps in managing room inventory and pricing strategies more effectively, ensuring maximum occupancy and revenue.

Another important aspect is the distribution of booking channels. By examining whether bookings come through direct channels (such as the hotel’s website), online travel agencies (OTAs), or corporate accounts, hotels can determine which platforms are most effective. This insight allows for optimized channel management, ensuring that marketing efforts and resources are allocated to the most productive channels. For example, if OTAs generate a significant portion of bookings, investing in better positioning and promotions on these platforms could be beneficial.

Trends and Patterns Analysis
Seasonality and Demand Fluctuations
Seasonal trends and demand fluctuations play a significant role in hotel bookings. By plotting booking data over time, hotels can identify peak seasons and off-peak periods. Understanding these trends is crucial for effective revenue management. During peak seasons, hotels can increase room rates to capitalize on high demand. Conversely, during off-peak times, offering promotional discounts and packages can help maintain occupancy levels.

Additionally, recognizing the impact of regional events, holidays, and festivals on booking patterns is essential. For example, if a city hosts a major annual festival, hotels can anticipate a surge in bookings and adjust their strategies accordingly. This might involve increasing staff levels, enhancing specific services, or offering special packages to attract more guests.

Analyzing longer-term trends can also provide insights into how booking patterns evolve over the years. This helps in forecasting future demand and making informed decisions about expansions, renovations, or changes in services offered.

Problem Statement
In today's world, traveling has become a top priority on everyone's bucket list. It transcends specific demographics or sectors, with a significant portion of the global population constantly on the move. Whether for starting anew in a different location or simply for enjoying a vacation, travel is a ubiquitous part of modern life. This surge in travel has placed hotels and motels at the forefront of the hospitality industry, as they are crucial in meeting the diverse needs of travelers.

However, the booking process often presents challenges that significantly influence travelers' choices. These challenges include the availability of desired amenities, the reliability of services, and the overall experience provided by the hotel. Consequently, travelers are becoming more discerning and selective, seeking accommodations that not only meet their basic needs but also offer value in terms of facilities and trustworthiness.

Define Your Business Objective?
The primary objective is to address the challenges faced by hotels and motels during peak seasons and to meet the heightened demands of customers. This involves optimizing hotel amenities and facilities to manage expenses effectively and achieve profitable outcomes for the hotel industry.

What did you know about your dataset?
The dataset reveals distinct categories related to anomalies from a hotel's perspective, encompassing factors like company affiliation, lead time, distribution channels, and special guest requests—elements not typically observed. These insights signify significant shifts in prevailing conditions. Additionally, the dataset is characterized by an extensive array of rows and columns, punctuated by the presence of duplicate entries and missing values. Addressing these anomalies and discrepancies forms a critical component of our forthcoming data wrangling process

Before commencing our data wrangling process, it's imperative to create a duplicate of our current dataset to document its original shape and to facilitate the comparison of any alterations made during the cleaning phase.


h1_df = h_df.copy()
     
3. Data Wrangling
Data Wrangling Code
Lets start with removing duplicate values


h1_df = h1_df.drop_duplicates()
     
From the above plot we can see that we have an ample amount of missing values in some of the columns of our dataset which needs to be handled


null_columns = ['agent','children','company']
for col in null_columns:
  h1_df[col].fillna(0,inplace = True)

h1_df['country'].fillna('others',inplace = True)
     

h1_df.isna().sum().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index().rename(columns={'index':'Columns',0:'Null values'})
     
Columns	Null values
0	hotel	0
1	is_canceled	0

30	lead_time	0
31	reservation_status_date	0

len(h1_df[h1_df['adults']+h1_df['babies']+h1_df['children']==0])
h1_df.drop(h1_df[h1_df['adults']+h1_df['babies']+h1_df['children']==0].index,inplace = True)
     
Lets add some new columns to the dataset


h1_df['total_people'] = h1_df['adults']+h1_df['babies']+h1_df['children']
h1_df['total_stays'] = h1_df['stays_in_weekend_nights'] + h1_df['stays_in_week_nights']
     

h1_df['reserved_room_type'] = h1_df['reserved_room_type'].replace({
    'A': 'Single Room',
    'B': 'Double Room',
    'C': 'Twin Room',
    'D': 'Triple Room',
    'E': 'Quad Room',
    'F': 'Queen Room',
    'G': 'King Room',
    'H': 'Studio Room',
    'L': 'Deluxe Room'
})
     

h1_df['total_of_special_requests'].unique()
h1_df['total_of_special_requests'] = h1_df['total_of_special_requests'].replace({0:'Early Check-in',1:'Late Check-out',2:'Room Preference',3:'Extra Bed or Cot',4:'Special Amenities',5:'Room Upgrades'})
     
Lets see what new information we derive from our dataset

What all manipulations have you done and insights you found?
Upon inspecting the dataset, it became evident that certain anomalies were present, necessitating data transformation. As part of the basic data cleaning process, we took measures to remove redundant or irrelevant data points. Additionally, it was observed that some constraints within the dataset exhibited disparate distributions. To address this, we aggregated these constraints and created new columns, which proved instrumental for subsequent visualization tasks. This process not only enhanced the dataset's coherence but also facilitated more insightful exploratory analysis.

4. Data Vizualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with charts : Understand the relationships between variables
Which type of hotel is most frequently chosen by customers?


hotel_counts = h1_df['hotel'].value_counts()

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
To kick-start our analysis on the specific needs of our customers, we conducted a univariate analysis on the hotel type. The results revealed that the majority of customers prefer City Hotels over Resort Hotels.

City Hotel:
Located in urban areas, catering primarily to business travelers with essential amenities like Wi-Fi and meeting rooms.
Resort Hotel:
Situated in vacation destinations, offering extensive recreational facilities for leisure travelers.
3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

We observed that 61% of our customers prefer city hotels over resorts. This is positive for our business, but it doesn't mean we should neglect the resort segment. While resort hotels are performing well, they require certain improvements to meet customer needs better, which we will address in due course.

Insights
Based on the booking trends, we can clearly see a significant spike in bookings between 2015 and 2016, followed by a gradual decrease between 2016 and 2017. This fluctuation could be attributed to various events or factors specific to those years.

Furthermore, an analysis of monthly booking patterns reveals that the highest number of bookings occurred from May to August, which aligns with the peak summer season. This seasonal trend is consistent with increased travel and vacation activities during this period.

When comparing bookings made on weekdays versus weekends, the data shows a substantial difference. Approximately 30,000 bookings were made on weekdays, while weekends saw about 80,000 bookings for both city and resort destinations.

Lastly, an evaluation of our agents' performance revealed that Agent 9 made an impressive 28,000 bookings, significantly outpacing Agent 240, who made 13,000 bookings for resorts. This indicates a notable difference in performance among our agents.

Insights
One of the main objectives of this analysis was to understand customer demographics. After a thorough analysis, we found that the majority of guests traveled from Portugal, followed by the UK and France. This insight provides a clear direction on prioritizing our marketing efforts towards these countries to enhance business growth.

Additionally, we examined the distribution of customer types. Transient customers accounted for a high volume of bookings at 82%, followed by Transient Party customers at 13%. This information helps us focus our marketing strategies on the most significant customer segments.

Moreover, the data indicates that new guests have a higher booking rate compared to repeat guests. This highlights a potential area of neglect towards our existing customers, suggesting a need for strategies to improve customer retention alongside attracting new guests.

Insights
When initiating our analysis, we encountered several constraints pertinent to hotel bookings. Among these, customer preferences emerged as a significant factor. Our analysis revealed that a substantial portion of preferences leaned towards single-room accommodations. Approximately 40,000 bookings were observed for city-type hotels, whereas resort-type hotels accounted for around 17,000 bookings in this category.

Furthermore, our investigation unearthed a prevalent customer request, indicating a distinct inclination towards early check-in and late check-out options. This preference aligns with the desire for added flexibility and convenience during their stay, showcasing the importance of accommodating such requests to enhance overall guest satisfaction and experience.

Insights
One of the major concerns in the hotel industry is cancellations, which can significantly impact operations. After conducting a thorough analysis, we found that the cancellation rate is currently 27%, which is an improvement compared to previous years. An interesting insight from our analysis is that cancellations are more frequent for Single rooms, particularly when the lead time (the time between booking and the stay) ranges from 100 to 400 days.

Insights
The revenue analysis reveals compelling insights into the performance and dynamics of the hospitality business:

The Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) stand out as key indicators of financial health, with ADR averaging 544 million and RevPAR totaling 394 million. These figures reflect the revenue generated per room and highlight the overall profitability of the establishment.

When examining revenue by room type, single rooms emerge as significant contributors, generating approximately $112 million. This underscores the popularity and demand for single-room accommodations among guests, emphasizing the importance of catering to this segment's preferences.

Furthermore, customer type preferences play a pivotal role in revenue generation, particularly with transient guests. In the resort segment, transient guests contribute substantially, accounting for $128 million in revenue. This underscores the importance of understanding and catering to the needs and preferences of transient guests to capitalize on revenue opportunities effectively.

These insights provide valuable guidance for strategic decision-making, enabling hoteliers to optimize revenue streams, enhance guest satisfaction, and tailor services to meet the diverse needs of their clientele.

Conclusion
Guests displayed a marked preference for City hotels, making these establishments the busiest type of accommodation. This trend underscores the appeal of urban environments for a variety of travelers, including both business and leisure tourists. The allure of city centers with their proximity to business districts, cultural landmarks, shopping areas, and diverse dining and entertainment options likely contributes to this preference. The bustling atmosphere and convenience offered by City hotels make them a top choice for guests seeking an immersive urban experience.

Interestingly, a significant portion of all bookings—27.5%—were cancelled. This high cancellation rate suggests a notable level of uncertainty or changeability in travel plans among guests. Several factors could contribute to this, including fluctuations in travel restrictions, personal emergencies, or the emergence of more attractive last-minute deals elsewhere. The high cancellation rate might also indicate a need for hotels to adopt more flexible booking policies to accommodate the dynamic nature of travelers’ plans.

The retention rate of guests was quite low, with only 3.9% of guests revisiting the hotels. This statistic highlights a potential area for improvement in customer satisfaction and loyalty programs. Low repeat visitation suggests that while guests might enjoy their stay, the experience isn’t compelling enough to bring them back. Enhancing customer service, personalized experiences, and loyalty rewards could be strategic moves to improve this retention rate.

When examining booking behaviors, it’s notable that over 82% of bookings were made without any subsequent changes. This indicates a high level of initial commitment and satisfaction with the booking details provided at the time of reservation. About 10% of bookings, however, did see single changes made, showing that some guests needed to adjust their plans post-booking, possibly due to minor changes in their travel itinerary.

Booking channels also reveal interesting insights. Approximately 79.1% of bookings were made through travel agents or tour operators. This underscores the significant role that these intermediaries play in the travel and hospitality industry. The convenience, bundled deals, and perceived security offered by travel agents and tour operators likely drive this high percentage. It reflects guests’ preference for the streamlined and often more comprehensive services provided by these booking channels.

The geographical origin of guests shows that more than 25,000 guests hailed from Portugal, making it the country with the highest number of guests. This highlights the strong domestic market for these hotels, suggesting that Portuguese travelers either prefer exploring their own country or find it convenient to stay within national boundaries for their vacations or business trips.

Most bookings for both City and Resort hotels were recorded in 2016, indicating that this was a particularly strong year for travel. This surge could be attributed to various factors such as favorable economic conditions, effective tourism promotions, or significant events that drew visitors to these destinations during that year.

City hotels not only attracted more guests but also generated higher revenue compared to Resort hotels, thanks to a higher average daily rate (ADR). This financial edge likely stems from the premium prices that can be charged in urban centers where demand is consistently high and guests are willing to pay more for the convenience and amenities provided.

However, City hotels also faced a higher booking cancellation rate of almost 30%. This could be due to the dynamic nature of urban travel, where plans are more likely to change compared to the more relaxed pace associated with resort stays. In contrast, Resort hotels had a higher average lead time, with guests booking their stays further in advance. This reflects the more deliberate planning often required for resort vacations, which typically involve longer stays and more detailed arrangements.

Waiting times were higher for City hotels, further indicating their busier status. This likely reflects the high turnover rate and demand for services in urban settings, necessitating longer waits for activities like check-in and check-out.

Interestingly, Resort hotels boasted the highest number of repeat guests. This suggests strong customer loyalty, with guests enjoying their experiences at these resorts enough to return. The optimal stay duration for both City and Resort hotels was less than seven days, with guests typically staying for about a week. This duration fits well with both business and leisure travel patterns, offering enough time for both work and relaxation.

Despite not always getting the reserved room, about 19% of guests did not cancel their bookings, while only 2.5% opted to cancel under these circumstances. This indicates a level of flexibility and willingness to adjust expectations among the majority of guests, prioritizing their travel plans over specific room preferences.
